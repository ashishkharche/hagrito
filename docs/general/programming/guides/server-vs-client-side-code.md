# Server side vs Client side code

## Client-side

Client-side code is code that is run on the user's computer â€” when a web page is viewed, the page's client-side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser.

## Server-side

Server-side code on the other hand is run on the server, then its results are downloaded and displayed in the browser. Examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, ASP.NET and... JavaScript! JavaScript can also be used as a server-side language, for example in the popular Node.js environment.
