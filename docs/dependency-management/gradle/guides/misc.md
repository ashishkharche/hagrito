# Gradle - Misc

## Gradle Groovy Library

Gradle ships with its own Groovy library, therefore Groovy does not need to be installed. Any existing Groovy installation is ignored by Gradle.

## JVM and Native

Note that Gradle isnâ€™t limited to building just JVM projects, and it even comes packaged with support for building native projects.
