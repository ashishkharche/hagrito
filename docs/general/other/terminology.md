## HTML

[HTML](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a _markup language_ that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.

## HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.

## DNS

Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place.

## Servers 

Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.
