# Computer Science - Misc

## Byte and Bit

The computer industry has historically used the units **kilobyte**, **megabyte**, and **gigabyte** in at least two slightly different measurement systems which are slightly contradictory to each other.

*   The first one is a decimal-based system, which uses bytes in the powers of ten: **kilobyte** (10^3 bytes), **megabyte** (10^6 bytes), and **gigabyte** (10^9 bytes) and so on. These units are used by the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) (SI).
*   The second one is a binary-based system which uses bytes in the powers of two: **kilobyte** (2^10 bytes), **megabyte** (2^20 bytes), **gigabyte** (2^30 bytes) and so on. This system was actively used to describe computer memory.

To resolve this confusion, the [International Electrotechnical Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission "International Electrotechnical Commission") (IEC) suggested to use prefixes **kilo**, **mega** and **giga** only for the decimal-based system and to use new prefixes **kibi**, **mebi**, **gibi** for the binary-based system. Here **bi** means **bi**nary: **kibibyte** is **ki**lo **bi**nary **byte**.
