# async and defer

There are actually two modern features we can use to bypass the problem of the blocking script â€” `async` and `defer` (which we saw above). Let's look at the difference between these two.

Scripts loaded using the `async` attribute will download the script without blocking the page while the script is being fetched. However, once the download is complete, the script will execute, which blocks the page from rendering. You get no guarantee that scripts will run in any specific order. It is best to use `async` when the scripts in the page run independently from each other and depend on no other script on the page.

Scripts loaded with the `defer` attribute will load in the order they appear on the page. They won't run until the page content has all loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in place (e.g. they modify one or more elements on the page).

Here is a visual representation of the different script loading methods and what that means for your page:

![](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript/async-defer.jpg)

```js
<script async src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>

<script async src="js/script2.js"></script>

<script async src="js/script3.js"></script>
```

You can't rely on the order the scripts will load in. jquery.js may load before or after script2.js and script3.js and if this is the case, any functions in those scripts depending on jquery will produce an error because jquery will not be defined at the time the script runs.

`async` should be used when you have a bunch of background scripts to load in, and you just want to get them in place as soon as possible. For example, maybe you have some game data files to load, which will be needed when the game actually begins, but for now you just want to get on with showing the game intro, titles, and lobby, without them being blocked by script loading.

Scripts loaded using the `defer` attribute (see below) will run in the order they appear in the page and execute them as soon as the script and content are downloaded:

```js
<script defer src="js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>

<script defer src="js/script2.js"></script>

<script defer src="js/script3.js"></script>
```

In the second example, we can be sure that `jquery.js` will load before `script2.js` and `script3.js` and that `script2.js` will load before `script3.js`. They won't run until the page content has all loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in place (e.g. they modify one of more elements on the page).

To summarize:

*   `async` and `defer` both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a separate thread, while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, so the page loading is not blocked during the fetch process.
*   scripts with an `async` attribute will execute as soon as the download is complete. This blocks the page and does not guarantee any specific execution order.
*   scripts with a `defer` attribute will load in the order they are in and will only execute once everything has finished loading.
*   If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use `async`.
*   If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, load them using `defer` and put their corresponding `<script>` elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.
