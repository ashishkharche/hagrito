# Authorization types

**Authorization types:**

1.  **API key** represents API key authorization and used to access public data such as: searching for YouTube videos, sending sentences to the Cloud Natural Language API, accessing locations on Google Maps, or sending images to the Cloud Vision API.
2.  **OAuth client ID** represents _OAuth2 user account authorization_ and used for applications that will access _user_ data, such as Google Drive files, adding videos to a user's playlist, or adding rows of data to Google Sheets.
3.  **Service account** is similar to user account authorization with the only difference being the data is owned by another application or a robot user instead of a human user. _OAuth2 service account authorization_ is the primary way to access GCP APIs.
