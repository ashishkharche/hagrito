# Organization Template Workflow

If you have a workflow that multiple teams use within an organization, instead of re-creating the same workflow for each repository, you can promote consistency across your organization by using a workflow template that is defined in the organization's `.github` repository. Any member within the organization can use an organization template workflow and any repository within that organization has access to those template workflows.
