# XML - Misc

## Cons of XML

XML has an important disadvantage. Its redundant syntax causes higher storage and transportation cost. It is especially important when we need to store or transfer a large amount of data.

## Prologue

The first line in the XML document is called a **prologue:**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```

It specifies the version of the XML standard (usually 1.0) and defines the encoding (here it's UTF-8). The prologue is optional, but if it's there, it must come first in the document.

Note that a prologue does not have a closing tag!
