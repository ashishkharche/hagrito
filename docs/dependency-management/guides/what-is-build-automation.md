# What is Build Automation?

Build automation is the process of automating the creation of a software build and the associated processes. This includes compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests. A build - the process that converts files and other assets under the developersâ€™ responsibility into a software product in its final or consumable form - is automated when a final artifact(s) can be produced without direct human intervention and can be performed at any time with no information other than what is stored in the source code control repository.
