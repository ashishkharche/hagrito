# Copy extensions from one profile to another

Go to your chrome user data section.

On Windows, you can go to this path or if you set custom path, just navigate manually to chrome user data section.

```
%userprofile%\appdata\local\google\chrome\user data
```

Default profile is named as `Default` and other profiles are names as `Profile 4` for example.

Go to Extensions folder inside Default folder and then each extension folder is named with a long id. Copy whichever or all extensions to another Profile 4's Extension folder for example.
