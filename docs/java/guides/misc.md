# Java - Misc

## `System.out` - Standard output

**Standard output** is a receiver to which a program can send information as text. It is supported by all common operating systems. Java provides a special `System.out` object to work with the standard output. We will often use it to print data.

The name of this method (`main`) is predefined and should always be the same. Capitalization matters; if you name your first method like **Main**, **MAIN** or something else, the program cannot start.
