# __init__.py

The `__init__.py` files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages. This prevents directories with a common name, such as `string`, unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, `__init__.py` can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the `__all__` variable, described later.
