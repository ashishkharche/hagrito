# Request

REST framework introduces a `Request` object that extends the regular `HttpRequest`, and provides more flexible request parsing. The core functionality of the `Request` object is the `request.data` attribute, which is similar to `request.POST`, but more useful for working with Web APIs.

```
request.POST  # Only handles form data.  Only works for 'POST' method.
request.data  # Handles arbitrary data.  Works for 'POST', 'PUT' and 'PATCH' methods.
```
