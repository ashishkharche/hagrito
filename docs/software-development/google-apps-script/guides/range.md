# Range

Most data manipulation operations (for example, reading, writing, or formatting cell data) require you to define what cells the operation applies to. You can use the [**`Range`**](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range) class to select specific sets of cells within a sheet. Instances of this class represent a **range**â€”a group of one or more adjacent cells in a sheet. You can specify ranges by their row and column numbers, or by using A1 notation.
