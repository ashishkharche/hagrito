# Anime Summit Official Launch

## Description

After a long 3 months of preparation, and only a heart attack's worth of stress, it's finally here...the Anime Summit Podcast

Welcome, boys and girls, Onii-chans and Onee-san!

Three months ago I started putting together this podcast project. After some bumpy starts I recorded multiple practice sessions alone, and pitched them out to members of the [/r/anime](http://reddit.com/r/anime) community. I got lots of good feedback, but finding co-hosts was difficult. Eventually I wrangled in 3 such co-hosts and we got to recording more practices. At one point, we were recording 2 practice sessions a week as we upgraded our equipment and got more familiar with our software, and each other.

We managed to get a hold of some very talented artists and designers to give us our amazing Mascot character seen below. We still don't have a name for her, but I think we may go with Kaylee-chan. Tell us what you think in the comments!

They also gave us the wonderful logo you can see at the top of the page, featuring our mascot up front! Hopefully in the future we can get awesome artwork done of her in various topical anime outfits (Boobstring, anyone?)

But, here we are, launching with 5 episode ready for you to indulge in. Our aim is to keep our podcast under 1 hour and release 1 episode a week, every Monday! So now your drive to work on Monday mornings will be more entertaining, and you can keep thinking about your Waifu instead of your boss!

This post will be a short guide to these 5 available shows, as well as information on keeping up to date with the show and listening to it on your favorite device!

**Twitter**

You can follow us on Twitter [@AnimeSummit](http://twitter.com/AnimeSummit) to be kept abreast of new episodes, and other anime news we think you'll enjoy!

**iTunes**

For Apple users (and really confused android users) we have iTunes! Simply subscribe and listen at your liesure! [https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/anime-summit/id1018790874](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/anime-summit/id1018790874)

**RSS Feed**

For those with their favorite podcast apps, or able to figure it out, you can find our RSS feed here: [http://ranime.libsyn.com/rss](http://ranime.libsyn.com/rss)

At this time, we don't have any details on any apps that have us in their directory, but pretty much all podcast apps have an option for 'add from RSS'. Just plug that baby in and hit refresh every monday morning! I recommend [Podcast Addict on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict)

**In Browser**

For those a little simpler, or unwilling to make the serious commitment of subscribing, each post has a giant 'PLAY' button that you can just hit and listen to the podcast. Modern smartphones should be smart enough to figure out how to play the MP3s and modern browsers will handle it just fine as well!

Now onto the Content!

Here you'll get be introduced to our hosts, and learn about some of our favorite shows! Beware, there may be some small spoilers for some of the shows, especially if they're a bit older. We make a strong effort to avoid major spoilers, but trying to keep too much covered means we'd have nothing to talk about.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/86h3EVt.png)](http://animesummit.net/episode-02-spring-2015-anime-season)

We're back again to talk about some of our favorite shows from the Spring Season (about 11 episodes in at recording) and how we feel about them. Be prepared for Food Fights, and Band Camp! There may be small spoilers, but we've done our best to mainly discuss themes, and characters, and not major story moments! Enjoy!

What do rating systems mean to you? Do you score off pure artistic merit? Enjoyment? Recommend-ability? Does a 10 mean you tell your mom? Our hosts explain how they rate shows, and what numbers mean what to them. On top of that, they also discuss the merits of gore in shows, and what genres they've grown to love!

Every host was given the homework to find a show no more than one other host has seen, watch it, and prepare a little presentation on the show. The shows picked span the last 3 decades of anime! Who will come out on top?!

[![](https://i.imgur.com/Hdvb25X.png)](http://animesummit.net/episode-05-tropes-sequels-prequels-and-spinoffs)

Within these halls we talk about our recent experiences at Anime Expo 2015 and Convergence Minnesota. We also discuss our favorite tropes and those that really turn us off from watching a show. Eventually we get to talking about Sequels we dislike and those we wish existed, like K-On! University (Please?!?!)

Hopefully you enjoy our podcast! Please feel free to sing songs of our greatness, or tell us where we royally screwed up and where we can get better!
