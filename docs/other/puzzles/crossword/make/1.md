# TOPIC - Resources

## Words

### inflate

[View Binding  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)

### Any

The unified supertype type for all types in Kotlin is \operatorname{\texttt{kotlin.Any?}}kotlin.Any

[Type system - Kotlin language specification](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/type-system.html#glossary)

### CPS

abbr.

Every suspending function is associated with a generated Continuation subtype, which handles the suspension implementation; the function itself is adapted to accept an additional continuation parameter to support the Continuation Passing Style. 

[Asynchronous programming with coroutines - Kotlin language specification](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/asynchronous-programming-with-coroutines.html#continuation-passing-style)

### invoke

In this example, the invoke() method in FormatDateUseCase allows you to call instances of the class as if they were functions. The invoke() method is not restricted to any specific signature—it can take any number of parameters and return any type. You can also overload invoke() with different signatures in your class. You'd call the use case from the example above as follows:

### scopes

Kotlin program is logically divided into scopes.

[Scopes and identifiers - Kotlin language specification](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/scopes-and-identifiers.html#scopes-and-identifiers)

### Label

Labels are special syntactic marks which allow one to reference certain code fragments or elements. Lambda expressions) and loop statements are allowed to be labeled, with label identifier associated with the corresponding entity.

[Scopes and identifiers - Kotlin language specification](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/scopes-and-identifiers.html#scopes-and-identifiers)

### when 

Use a when expression without an argument, which in Kotlin acts as a series of if/else if checks.

[Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers 3: Functions](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-functions#4)


### inline 

It is thus highly discouraged to compare inline classes by reference.

There is an exception to these rules: values of value classes are not guaranteed to be reference equal even if they are created by the same constructor invocation as said constructor invocation is explicitly allowed to be inlined by the compiler. It is thus highly discouraged to compare inline classes by reference.

[Expressions - Kotlin language specification](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/expressions.html#expressions)

### rail

The rail is a side navigation component that displays three to seven app destinations and, optionally, a Floating Action Button. Each destination is represented by an icon and a text label.

[Navigation rail - Material Design](https://material.io/components/navigation-rail#usage)

### Bundle

Instance state data is stored as simple key/value pairs in a Bundle. Use the Bundle methods to put data into and get data back out of the Bundle.   

[Android fundamentals 02.2: Activity lifecycle and state  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-training-activity-lifecycle-and-state?index=..%2F..%2Fandroid-training#5)

### Dao

The data access object, or Dao, is an annotated class where you specify SQL queries and associate them with method calls. 

[Android fundamentals 10.1 Part A: Room, LiveData, and ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-training-livedata-viewmodel?index=..%2F..%2Fandroid-training#4)

### NaN

A constant holding the "not a number" value of Double.

### Anko 

Anko is a Kotlin library which makes Android application development faster and easier. It makes your code clean and easy to read, and lets you forget about rough edges of the Android SDK for Java.

[NaN - Kotlin Programming Language](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-double/-na-n.html)
