# Cloud Shell and virtual environments

When using Cloud Shell, you're not in a situation where a virtual environment is a necessity (as described above). The Cloud Shell contains all the default Python packages that are part of the Cloud SDK whereas a new virtual environment will not. You'd need to go through that installation process if you choose to use a virtual environment in Cloud Shell.
