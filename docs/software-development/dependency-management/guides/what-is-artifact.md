# What is Artifact?

The word artifact is from the Latin phrase arte factum: arte meaning skill and factum meaning to make. In the software development life cycle, artifact usually refers to objects that are produced by people involved in the process. Examples would be design documents, data models, workflow diagrams, test matrices and plans, setup scripts including compiled binaries, and software packages. In most software development cycles, thereâ€™s usually a list of specific required artifacts that someone must produce and put on a shared drive or document repository for other people to view and share. Artifact may occasionally refer to the released code (in the case of a code library) or the released executable (in the case of a program). An artifact is the byproduct of software development.
