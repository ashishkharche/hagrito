## Description

When Kwoka's away, the boys will play.

Kwoka was unable to record on the normal night, so Som, Nick, and Mac decide to dive into the world of salt with waifu wars and hooliganism in this special episode of Anime Summit AO. The 'AO' is a reference to Eureka 7 AO which was absolutely terrible. Like that, this episode is absolutely terrible.

No timestamps exist, because little is accomplished.
