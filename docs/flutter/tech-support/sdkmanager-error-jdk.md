# SDKManager error related to JDK when trying to install

```
I encounterd this when I set the JAVA_HOME with AdoptOpenJDK 11 or 14, after I set it back to OpenJDK 8 it works well.

Make sure that you have a version of Java 8 installed and that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the JDKâ€™s folder.
