# Kernel

The Windows operating systems are based on Windows NT kernel.

A kernel is the most important part of an operating system - it performs important functions like process management, memory management, filesystem management etc.

Linux operating systems are based on the Linux kernel. A Linux based operating system will consist of Linux kernel, GUI/CLI, system libraries and system utilities. The Linux kernel was independently developed and released by Linus Torvalds. The Linux kernel is free and open-source - [https://github.com/torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)

Linux is a kernel and and not a complete operating system. Linux kernel is combined with GNU system to make a complete operating system. Therefore, linux based operating systems are also called as GNU/Linux systems. GNU is an extensive collection of free softwares like compiler, debugger, C library etc. [Linux and the GNU System](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html)
