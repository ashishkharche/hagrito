# What is Build Tool?

The process of building a computer program is usually managed by a build tool, a program that coordinates and controls other programs. Examples of such programs are Make, Gradle, Meister by OpenMake Software, Ant, Maven, Rake, SCons, and Phing. The build utility typically needs to compile the various files in the correct order, download dependencies, run unit and integration tests, and any other related tasks for producing binaries that can be deployed.
