# Number Systems

We even have different types of number systems! Decimal is base 10 (meaning it uses 0–9 in each column), but we also have things like:

- **Binary** — The lowest level language of computers; 0s and 1s.

- **Octal** — Base 8, uses 0–7 in each column.

- **Hexadecimal** — Base 16, uses 0–9 and then a–f in each column. You may have encountered these numbers before when setting colors in CSS.
