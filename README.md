## Roadmap

- [ ] Add Netlify CMS to simplify content writing process.

## Contributions

**NOTE**: The below methods would be less attractive when the Netlify CMS gets deployed soon. It's on the roadmap.

**NOTE**: When adding new content, please follow the proper format. You can refer to, for example, [other AO episodes format](https://github.com/androiddevnotes/animesummit/blob/main/docs/episodes/ao/ao-episode-1-wiafu-wars-and-other-nonsense.md) and get an idea of how you would want to name files and headings and other content.
