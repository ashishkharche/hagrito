## Description

_This page is accessible by visiting [http://fitness.animesummit.net](http://fitness.animesummit.net "http://fitness.animesummit.net") for easy access._

Time for the first Anime Summit contest! Get fit with anime girls and win sweet prizes!

**Anitore! EX**

Anitore! EX is a Fall 2015 anime that premieres on October 13th with the premise of having young girls training to become Idols assist you in bettering yourself (and reducing your Body Fat by 1000%*). Just follow along with the exercises and enjoy their encouragement!

To view the show on My Anime List, [click here](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31519/Anitore!_EX).

Anitore! EX is available to stream on [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-de-training-ex).

**Prizes! EX**

Of course, nobody wants to better themselves without the potential for sweet loot, so of course we will offer prizes! Right now, the prize options are not finalized, as the amount of interest in this challenge will dictate the amount and value of prizes. In the future, this page will be updated to reflect the actual prizes.

For now, just know that $100 in Nendoroids from the Good Smile Company will be on the line at a minimum.

**Rules! EX**

The rules are pretty simple: Lose as much weight as possible between **NOW** and the final episode of Anitore! EX (Date Unknown at this time). This weight can be lost by any means you wish, whether gym, cardio, yoga, crossfit, diet, or any combination of the above. Technically, you don't even need to work out with the Anitore! EX girls, but that is the spirit of the competition.

To enter, simply send an email containing a picture of your on a scale with the numbers visible (could just be your feet to make this easy) to [Fitness@Animesummit.net](mailto:Fitness@Animesummit.net "mailto:Fitness@Animesummit.net") with "Fitness Challenge" in the subject line at some point between now and the contest end date.

A second photo will need to be sent as above on the contest end date to show the difference between weights. You will receive a reminder email around this time.

And then just wait for your prizes! You don't even need to like, favorite, or subscribe, though we would appreciate it!

*Reducing your body fat by 1000% is dangerous and you should not do it.
