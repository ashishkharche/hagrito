# AWS - Concepts

## Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT.

Take a MySQL database as an example. If your business runs a MySQL database, does your ability to install the MySQL engine make you a better company than your competitors? Well, probably not that. Do you keep backups in a way that makes you superior to other players in your vertical? Again, doubtful. The data inside your database, now that's critically different. The way you build your tables and manage the structures, absolutely separates you from the competition. But the engine is just the engine. 

At AWS, we call that the undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT. Tasks that are common, often repetitive and ultimately time-consuming; these are the tasks AWS wants to help you with.
