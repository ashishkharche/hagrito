# Gossip Protocol

A gossip protocol is a procedure or process of computer peer-to-peer communication that is based on the way epidemics spread.[1] Some distributed systems use peer-to-peer gossip to ensure that data is disseminated to all members of a group. Some ad-hoc networks have no central registry and the only way to spread common data is to rely on each member to pass it along to their neighbours.
