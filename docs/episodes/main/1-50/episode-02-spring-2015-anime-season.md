We're back again to talk about some of our favorite shows from the Spring Season (about 11 episodes in at recording) and how we feel about them. Be prepared for Food Fights, and Band Camp! There may be small spoilers, but we've done our best to mainly discuss themes, and characters, and not major story moments! Enjoy!
