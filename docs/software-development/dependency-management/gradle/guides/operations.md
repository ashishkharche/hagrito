## Discover the project structure

Either import the build with an IDE or run `gradle projects` from the command line. If only the root project is listed, it’s a single-project build. Otherwise it’s a [multi-project build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/intro_multi_project_builds.html#intro_multi_project_builds).
