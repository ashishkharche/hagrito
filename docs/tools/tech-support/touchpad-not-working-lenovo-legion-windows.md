> -Using Driver Booster 8 to automatically update drivers on the Legion 5 Pro messes up the trackpad driver. Device Manager --> Keyboards shows 'Lenovo Keyboard' with a yellow exclamation mark. Right click -> Properties -> Update Driver -> Browse my computer for drivers -> Let me pick from available drivers -> [Pick the one that's NOT Lenovo Keyboard]
