# Identifier field

Netlify CMS expects every entry to provide a field named `"title"` that serves as an identifier for the entry. The identifier field serves as an entry's title when viewing a list of entries, and is used in [slug](#slug) creation. If you would like to use a field other than `"title"` as the identifier, you can set `identifier_field` to the name of the other field.
