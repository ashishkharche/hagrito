# When it is charged

**Charges will accrue for any active service, even if it is powered off or otherwise not in use.** This includes Linode Compute Instances that have been powered off as well as any service you might have added to the account but are not using. When a Compute Instance is on your account, the data is still maintained and resources (such as RAM and network capacity) are still reserved. To avoid additional charges for a service you no longer need, [remove the service](/docs/guides/manage-billing-in-cloud-manager/#removing-services) from your account.

## Hourly or monthly

For example, the base Linode plan is $0.03/hour with a monthly cap of $20/month. Keeping a Linode only for a few hours means you only pay the hourly rate. But, you'll never pay more than the monthly cap for a Linode, despite months having a different number of hours in them.
