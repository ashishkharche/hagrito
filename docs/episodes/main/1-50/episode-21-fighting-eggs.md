This week, Som and Nick have some shows for you. To start it off, we'll talk about a prototypical highschool fight anime drowning in flashbacks. Should you watch it? Find out! Following that we delve into a long discussion on the merits of a very atmospheric movie covering the search for religion...maybe.

Episode OP/ED: [[Gurren Lagann] Sorairo Days (English) by Sapphire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfhmP-OznM4)
