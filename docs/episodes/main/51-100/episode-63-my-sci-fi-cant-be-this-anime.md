## Description

A little late, but just as good! The gang is back to talk about Science Fiction technology in Anime, and get in an argument about Evangelion and Gundam references.

Anime allows a very interesting means of displaying potential future technologies, heaving spent a long time not dealing with the technological limitations of faking future tech, even more so than modern CG. So what interesting has come of it?

Due to Kwoka traveling a bunch, and many technical issues getting this episode out, there will be no show notes. Sorry.
